## Audience Segmentation using Logistic Regression

### About:

A basic replica of youtube algorithm! Classifies the viewers into several groups based on their interests. Uses Logistic Regression algorithm. 

### Developed by:
[Vigneshwar Ravichandar](https://github.com/ToastCoder)

### Classes:

1. Young adult ( if the value of 'res' in test.py is 'array([[0]])' )

2. 1 - Engineering Student ( if the value of 'res' in test.py is 'array([[1]])' )

3. 2 - Medical Student ( if the value of 'res' in test.py is 'array([[2]])' )

4. 3 - Teachers ( if the value of 'res' in test.py is 'array([[3]])' )

5. 4 - Adults ( if the value of 'res' in test.py is 'array([[4]])' )

6. 5 - Travelling kinda person ( if the value of 'res' in test.py is 'array([[5]])' )

7. 6 - Media Freak ( if the value of 'res' in test.py is 'array([[6]])' )

### Features: 

1. Technology

2. Politics

3. Food

4. Education

5. Media

6. Travel

7. Medicine

### Execution Instructions:

### Windows:

1. Install the required packages.

2. Execute train.py to retrain the model again.

3. Execute visualizer.py to visualize the working of the algorithm.

4. Execute test.py to test the model for executing the algorithm with user defined data.

### MacOS / Linux:

There is a script autorun.sh for automating all the process.

1. Execute the autorun.sh script in terminal.

2. Press Y for executing the script.

3. Enter password if asked.

4. This will install all the dependencies and runs the code in order.

5. Press Y for retraining the model. Else press N.

6. Press Y for visualizing the model's working. Else press N.

7. For classifying a particular data. Follow the wizard by either by pressing Y or N.

8. The algorithm will classify the type of audience for the mentioned person. Enjoy!
